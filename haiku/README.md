# Haiku Documentation

First, I looked up my favorite Japanese author, Yukio Mishima, and checked to see if he had any Haikus.
I found a haiku by him where he writes, "おとうとがお手手ひろげてもみじかな".
Translated this reads, "My younger brother spreads his palms, maple leaves".

Then, I listed this command inside the terminal:
`say -o output.aiff "Otōto ga o-tete hirogete momiji kana"`

After this, I appropriately renamed the audio file and put it inside the allocated folder.
