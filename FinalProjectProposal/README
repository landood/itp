# Final Project Proposal

### Title
Additive Synth

### Summary
My project is an additive synth developed in p5.js

### Resources
1. https://p5js.org/tutorials/simple-melody-app/
2. https://archive.p5js.org/learn/
3. https://archive.p5js.org/examples/

### Details
My goal is to create a simple synth that will use a combination of three sin waves. I will utilize key mapping to be able to change the notes and manipulate the instrument. In order to do this, I will have to program the waves in first and then program a way for the wave cycles to either expand or condense depending on the key being pressed. If all of this end up being finished, I hope to also impliment midi

### Project Overlap
While this project does not directly overlap with any of my other classes, I am currently learning Max, so knowing more about the coding process behind creating an additive synth will hopefully help me to understand Max a little bit better.

### Good Outcome
A good outcome that I would be satisfied with is just being able to create a synth that can produce at least one sound. Because I am a complete beginner to coding, I think that this would be a good outcome.

### Better Outcome
A better outcome his being able to play multiple notes on the synth while also having key mapping.

### Best Outcome
The best outcome for this project is a synth that can play a wide range of notes and is midi controlled.

### Project Outline

**Week 1**: Learn how to program a sin wave. Study the tutorials found in p5.js.

**Week 2**: Program a way to play the sin waves along side each other. Develope the additive synth. 

**Week 3**: Program the key mapping/midi mapping. Build the interface that will be used.
