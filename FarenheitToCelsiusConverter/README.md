### What I did
For this assignment, I made a program that can convert 99 Farenheit to celsius.

### How I did it
I wrote all of my code in the javascript sandbox that was shown to us in class. At first, I tried to figure out how to make a program that was a full farenheit to celsius converter, but after a time of research, I realized that there was a much easier way that was spelled out in the text we read.

I started out by equating "f" to "99" with the command:

`let f = 99;`

This set up made it so that I only had to equate celsius to the equation, so my next line of code was:

`let c = (f - 32) * 5 / 9;`

Lastly, I had to write a line of code that commanded the computer to calculate the outcome. I did this with the line:

`console.log ((f - 32) * 5 / 9);`

The result of this was: 37.22222222222222

In the debugging issues, I suprisingly had the hardest time with the easiest aspect of the code which, for me, was the last line. I struggled with trying to figure out how to ask the computer to give me the answer. Luckily, I was able to find the answer inside the reading because all of the example codes ended with the template:

`console.log (put equation here)`
