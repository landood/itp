# Python Reading

## Chapter 1
One thing I didn't know was that Python has two modes: immediate mode and script mode.

One thing I did know is the concept of high-level languages and low-level languages.

## Chapter 3
I didn't know what a turtle in the context of Python was.

I had seen someone use turtle graphics before so I knew that it existed, but I didn't know the name of it nor how it worked.

## Chapter 5
I knew what a Boolean value was through our ealier reading.

I didn't know about the usage of "not operators" within Python. It's easy to understand, but I can see where it could be confusing.

## Chapter 10: Lists
I didn't know about the "in operator". I knew about lists, but  have never used lists in a way that I would use the "in operator".

As I said before, I knew about lists before reading this chapter. I believe we've used them before for homework, but I have definitely used them in my private experimentation.
